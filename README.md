#  Dynamic Muscle Intensity Tracker

This is a Swift app designed for logging workouts.

# Run App
Initiate app in XCode or IDE that supports connection to iOS devices.
Connect iOS device to computer, select device, and build.

# Features
Users first register muscle groups that they would like to keep track of
during their workouts (chest, legs, back, etc.). Users can set their goals based
on the minimum and maximum number of sets they would like to perform per muscle group
per week.
